To make the API a bit more agnostic regarding the internal image processing library
we provide our graphic primitives (like Size, Rectangle etc.)

Those types are intentionally very simple and don't provide a lot of functionallity.
Some things are inspired on other libraries primitives like ImageSharp, SkiaSharp or System.Drawing
